I express my sincere gratitude to my project guide Dr. Sorav Bansal. I would specially like to thank my guide Dr. Sorav Bansal and Varun Sethi from Freescale Semiconductor for they were always available with quick solutions to any problem I ever faced and for their valuable feedback at all times. I am also grateful to the evaluation committee including Prof. Subodh Kumar and Prof. Huzur Saran whose evalutions helped me understand the problem better. 
I would also like to acknowledge my fellow mate Dushyant Bansal who was involved in the development of this project. Working was fun with him.
