I express my sincere gratitude to my project guides Dr. Smruti Ranjan Sarangi and Dr. M. BalaKrishnan. I would specially like to thank my guide Sarangi Sir for he was always available with quick solutions to any problem I ever faced and to Bala Sir for his valuable feedback at all times. I am also grateful to the evaluation committee including Anshul Sir, Kolin Sir, Preeti Ranjan Sir and Shampa Chakraverty Madam whose evalutions helped me understand the problem better. 
I would also like to acknowledge my fellow mates of Srishti group Kapil, Mayur, Moksh, Raj, Pooja, Prathmesh, who were involved in the development of \emph{Tejas} and Gayathri, Lalitha, Pavan, Solomon in the DST-DFG project. Working was fun with them.
